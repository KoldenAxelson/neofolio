# Neofolio

An AI-readable, opinionated portfolio template for developers in the AI age —
built on the **OX Stack** (Hugo · Tailwind · Go · HTMX · Alpine · TypeScript).
Node-free build, Lighthouse-optimized, structured for both human readers and the
AI systems that increasingly summarize you to them.

**Live demo → [koldenaxelson.github.io/neofolio](https://koldenaxelson.github.io/neofolio/)**

## Why

Every page serves two audiences: the human reading it and the model summarizing
it. So all meaningful content is in static HTML, backed by a JSON-LD entity
graph (a single `Person`/`WebSite` identity that every page references by `@id`)
and a build-time [`/llms.txt`](https://koldenaxelson.github.io/neofolio/llms.txt).
RSS, JSON Feed, robots, and sitemap come for free.

The stack is deliberately lean: two compiled binaries (Hugo + the Tailwind
standalone CLI) and Hugo's built-in esbuild for TypeScript — **no `npm`, no
`node_modules`, no framework runtime** on the static pages. Client interactivity
is a ~2–3KB TypeScript bundle; `hx-boost` adds SPA-style navigation; Alpine.js
appears only on the one page that needs reactive state (`/network`).

See [`ox-stack.md`](./ox-stack.md) for the stack and the reasoning behind each
choice, and [`ox-cloudflare.md`](./ox-cloudflare.md) for a recommended dynamic
deployment path.

## Quick start

The toolchain is two binaries, fetched per-platform — no package manager:

```bash
make setup    # download the Hugo + Tailwind binaries into ./bin (one-time)
make dev      # local server at http://localhost:1313 with live CSS rebuild
make build    # production build to ./public
```

Run `make help` for the full list.

## Make it yours

1. **`data/site.yaml`** — identity, links, nav, locale. Edit this first.
2. **`data/cv.yaml`** — work history, education, skills (drives `/cv`, the
   homepage Experience section, and the `Person.hasOccupation` JSON-LD).
3. **`content/`** — projects, articles, and the `now`/`uses` pages as Markdown
   with front matter. **`data/`** — `network/` and `certificates/` as YAML.
4. **`assets/css/base.css`** — the five theme tokens (`--c-*`) for light/dark.

## Structure

```
assets/         CSS (Tailwind entry + base) and TypeScript interactivity
content/        projects, articles, now, uses, network, cv, certificates
data/           site.yaml, cv.yaml, icons, network/, certificates/, archive/
layouts/        Hugo templates (baseof, pages, partials, schema/, JSON-LD)
static/         fonts, textures, covers, badges, favicon, og image
```

## Deploying

Pushing to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds with the
Node-free toolchain and publishes to GitHub Pages. The base URL (including a
project-site sub-path like `/neofolio`) is derived automatically from Pages
config, so every absolute URL — links, JSON-LD `@id`s, feeds, sitemap — stays
consistent with no manual edits. Set **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub
Actions** once. See [`deploy_workflows.md`](./deploy_workflows.md) for details
and the Cloudflare alternative.
