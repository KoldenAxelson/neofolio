thoughts:
  - "12M req/day reads as a flex but most days it's the boring 7M. The flex is that it doesn't care which day it is."
  - "Per-tenant schema evolution is the feature nobody asks for in the demo and everyone needs by month three."

## Problem

The legacy ingest path was a synchronous monolith. Every customer onboarding required a deploy
because the schema lived in code. p99 latency was 1.4s on a good day. Schema mistakes leaked
into production roughly every six weeks.

## Constraints

- Zero downtime cutover — customers were live the whole time.
- Schemas had to be customer-editable but contract-tested before activation.
- Replay had to be deterministic for compliance audit.

## What I did

Designed a Kafka-backed pipeline with a schema-registry layer that enforces contract tests
on every schema change. Each tenant gets a logical topic; partitioning keeps replay
deterministic. The Postgres write path uses logical replication slots to power the
audit-replay tool.

```go
// Excerpt from the contract-test runner. Real version handles
// schema evolution graphs; this is the inner loop.
func runContractTests(prev, next *Schema, fixtures []Event) error {
    for _, ev := range fixtures {
        if err := validate(prev, ev); err != nil {
            continue // expected: this fixture is for the new shape
        }
        if err := validate(next, ev); err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("regression on fixture %s: %w", ev.ID, err)
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

## Outcome

- p99 latency: 1.4s → 220ms
- Schema-related incidents: ~9/year → 0 in the last 12 months
- Onboarding new customer schemas: 3-day deploy cycle → 20-minute self-serve

## What I'd do differently

I underestimated how much operational tooling we'd need around replay. If I were doing it
again I'd build the replay UI in parallel with the ingest path, not six months later.
