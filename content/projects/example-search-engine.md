thoughts:
  - "p95 under 80ms over 2.4M docs sounds heroic until you realize most of the work is the embedding pipeline, not the search."
  - "I spent two weeks tuning HNSW parameters before realizing the bottleneck was elsewhere. Classic."

## Problem

The wiki was 14 years old and 2.4M documents deep. Full-text search returned 800 hits for
"oncall rotation policy." Nobody trusted it. Slack searches for old conversations were the
de facto institutional memory.

## Constraints

- Couldn't ship documents to an external embedding API — most of them were internal-only.
- p95 query latency target: 100ms (it was 4s on the legacy system).
- Had to support both lexical and semantic search; the old system had only lexical.

## What I did

Combined three things: a Tantivy lexical index for keyword recall, a pgvector HNSW index
for semantic similarity using locally-hosted Jina embeddings, and a reranker that fuses
the two using reciprocal rank fusion. The frontend is a Cloudflare Worker that fans out
to both backends in parallel.

```rust
// Reciprocal rank fusion. Trivial math, surprisingly hard to beat empirically.
fn rrf(rankings: &[Vec<DocId>], k: f32) -> Vec<(DocId, f32)> {
    let mut scores: HashMap<DocId, f32> = HashMap::new();
    for ranking in rankings {
        for (rank, doc) in ranking.iter().enumerate() {
            *scores.entry(*doc).or_insert(0.0) += 1.0 / (k + rank as f32 + 1.0);
        }
    }
    let mut out: Vec<_> = scores.into_iter().collect();
    out.sort_by(|a, b| b.1.partial_cmp(&a.1).unwrap());
    out
}
```

## Outcome

- p95 query latency: 4s → 78ms
- Search usage (queries/week): 1.2k → 9.4k after 60 days
- One team retired their internal "Slack archive" Notion page that existed solely because
  search didn't work.

## What I'd do differently

I should have shipped lexical-only first and added semantic in a second pass. The unified
launch was harder to evaluate — when results were bad, you couldn't tell which pipeline
to blame.
