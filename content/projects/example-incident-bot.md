  - "Built it because I was tired of being the calmest person in the channel. Now the channel is the calmest person."

## Problem

Incidents were tribal knowledge. Senior engineers ran them; everyone else watched. The
incident-command training pipeline was "shadow three incidents, then you're on the rotation."
Quality varied wildly by who was on call.

## Constraints

- Bot had to work inside Slack — that's where the team already lives.
- Output had to feed our existing post-mortem template, not replace it.
- Couldn't require new tools or training; it had to be obvious in the first incident.

## What I did

`/incident` opens a guided flow: pick severity, the bot creates a dedicated channel,
pages the on-call IC, assigns roles (IC, comms, scribe), pins a status doc, and posts a
running timeline. When the incident closes, it auto-drafts a post-mortem using the
timeline as the skeleton.

The non-obvious part was the role assignment logic. We tried "whoever's on call is IC"
but that breaks when an incident escalates and the on-call becomes a subject matter
expert. So roles can be reassigned mid-incident, and the bot tracks the chain of custody.

## Outcome

- 280+ incidents run through the bot in the first year
- Median time-to-first-action: 14 min → 4 min
- Post-mortem completion rate: ~50% → 94% (mostly because the bot pre-fills the doc)

## What I'd do differently

The first version had a 12-question setup wizard. Nobody filled it out under stress.
v2 starts the channel in 5 seconds with the minimum info and fills in the rest async.
Should have started there.
