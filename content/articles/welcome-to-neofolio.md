# Welcome

Neofolio is an opinionated portfolio template for developers writing for two audiences at once:
**humans browsing your work** and **AI models that will, increasingly, summarize you to
those humans** before they ever click through.

Most portfolio templates optimize for the first audience and accidentally fail the second.
Neofolio optimizes for both, on purpose.

## The principles

1. **Content is HTML, not JavaScript.** Every meaningful sentence on this site is in the
   initial HTML payload. AI scrapers see the same thing humans do.
2. **Semantic elements everywhere.** `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<time>`. No `<div>`
   soup pretending to be structure.
3. **Schema.org JSON-LD on every page.** `Person`, `WebSite`, `BlogPosting`, `CreativeWork`.
   This is how you become a machine-readable entity.
4. **Vue only where it earns its keep.** The project filter on `/projects` is a Vue island. It
   hydrates on scroll, not on load. Nothing else needs JavaScript.

## How to use this template

1. Edit `src/config.ts` — your name, bio, links.
2. Edit `src/pages/cv.astro` — your experience data.
3. Drop MDX files into `src/content/projects/`, `src/content/posts/`, `src/content/archive/`.
4. Run `make setup` (or `bash setup.sh`) for the bits that need to happen on your machine.
5. Read [`docs/customization.md`](https://github.com/KoldenAxelson/neofolio/blob/main/docs/customization.md)
   and [`docs/deploying.md`](https://github.com/KoldenAxelson/neofolio/blob/main/docs/deploying.md)
   for the rest.
