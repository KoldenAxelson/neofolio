I've shipped portfolio sites on Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, S3+CloudFront, and
Cloudflare Pages. For a developer portfolio specifically, Cloudflare Pages is the
right default in 2026. Here's why.

## The criteria

A developer portfolio has narrow needs:

1. **Static-first.** It's documents and project descriptions. Anything dynamic should be
   an optional sidecar.
2. **Fast everywhere.** Recruiters in Berlin, Bangalore, and Buenos Aires all see your site.
3. **One small server-side thing.** Usually a contact form. Maybe an analytics endpoint.
4. **Cheap or free.** This is not the project where you spend money on infrastructure.
5. **Doesn't lock you in.** When the next platform appears, you can leave in an afternoon.

Pages clears all five. Vercel clears 1, 2, 4 (within limits), 5. Netlify is close. GitHub
Pages is fine for 1–4 and zero on the small server-side thing.

## What pushes me over the line on Cloudflare

**Workers are the contact-form layer.** No cold starts. < 50ms p99 worldwide.
The Pages + Workers split means your static site is unaffected by anything you do
server-side. They're separate domains in your head, even if they share a URL.

**Edge cache invalidation is instant.** When you push, the global edge is updated in
seconds, not minutes.

**The DNS / CDN is one product.** If you're already on Cloudflare for DNS (you should be),
you're not adding a second vendor.

**Build minutes are not metered the way Vercel meters them.** This matters once you start
publishing regularly. I've never seen a Pages build hit a quota.

## When I'd pick something else

- You need ISR or on-demand revalidation — Vercel is genuinely better at this.
- You're building a Next.js app that uses the framework's server features heavily — also Vercel.
- You want a free SSL certificate AND a `*.example.com` wildcard without a paid plan — GitHub Pages.

For a portfolio? Cloudflare. Almost every time.
