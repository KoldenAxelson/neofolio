Postgres has the best documentation of any database I've used and yet, when something is
on fire in production, the docs aren't where I look first. This is the actual sequence
of things I run.

## Step 1: What is currently running?

```sql
SELECT pid, age(clock_timestamp(), query_start), state, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle'
ORDER BY query_start ASC;
```

The longest-running query that isn't idle is almost always the cause. If you see
something stuck in `idle in transaction` for more than a few minutes, that's also a problem —
it's probably holding a lock somewhere.

## Step 2: Who's waiting on whom?

```sql
SELECT
  blocked.pid AS blocked_pid,
  blocked.query AS blocked_query,
  blocking.pid AS blocking_pid,
  blocking.query AS blocking_query
FROM pg_stat_activity blocked
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocking ON blocking.pid = ANY(pg_blocking_pids(blocked.pid));
```

This is the lock graph. If you've got cascading slowness, this query tells you which
transaction is at the root.

## Step 3: pg_stat_statements

If `pg_stat_statements` is enabled (and it should be), this is the long-tail view:

```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

Look at `total_exec_time`, not `mean_exec_time`. A query that runs in 30ms but executes
10M times a day is a much bigger problem than a query that runs in 4s but happens once
an hour.

## Step 4: EXPLAIN ANALYZE BUFFERS

When you've identified the bad query, EXPLAIN ANALYZE BUFFERS is the gold standard. The
key thing most people miss is `BUFFERS` — without it, you can't tell if a slow seq scan is
slow because it's CPU-bound or because it's pulling data off disk.

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE) SELECT ...;
```

If `shared read` numbers are huge, you need an index. If `shared hit` is huge and the query
is still slow, you have a query plan problem.

## Step 5: Indexes

The two things to check before adding a new index:

1. `pg_stat_user_indexes` — does an existing index serve this query and isn't being used?
2. The plan you're seeing now — would the index *actually* be used? Postgres's planner
   makes cost-based decisions; an index isn't free.

Half the time the answer is "fix the query to use the existing index." The other half
is "add the index but make it partial." Full-table indexes on huge tables are a footgun.

This is the shape of a Postgres debugging session in production. Every step takes 30
seconds. The whole loop, when you're in flow, runs in under five minutes. Most "slow
Postgres" stories I read could have been resolved in that time.
