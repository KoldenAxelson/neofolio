thoughts:
  - "The curl-htmlq moment was a punch in the gut. I rebuilt the next morning."
  - "Half my referral traffic now comes from AI summaries that quote my actual page copy. Worth the rewrite."

The first time I ran `curl https://my-old-site` and piped it through `htmlq -t`, I felt sick.
The site I'd shipped looked great in Chrome. In the curl output, it was a `<div id="root">`
and nothing else.

That's the gap. Humans see one website. AI scrapers — and the LLMs they feed — see a
different one. If you're a developer in 2026 and you care about being findable, surfaced,
or summarized accurately, you should know which version is yours.

## The test

```bash
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0" https://yoursite.com/cv | grep -o '<h2[^>]*>[^<]*</h2>'
```

If you get nothing back, your résumé is invisible to anything that doesn't run JavaScript.
That category includes most large-model crawlers, RSS readers, archive.org, and a surprising
number of corporate proxies.

## What changes if you fix it

Six months after rebuilding with static HTML, I started getting referral traffic from
sources I'd never seen before — `chat.openai.com`, `you.com`, `perplexity.ai`. The
phrasing in the referral previews matched my actual page copy. People were asking those
tools who I was, and the tools were citing me, accurately, instead of guessing.

That's the difference between being legible and being invisible.

## What good looks like

- Static HTML on first paint. Anything important shouldn't need JS.
- Semantic elements: `<article>`, `<section>`, `<time>`, `<nav>`.
- JSON-LD on every page. `Person` + `WebSite` site-wide. `BlogPosting` and `CreativeWork`
  where they apply.
- Tech stacks as text, not logo images. Names as text, not as a hero image.
- A `/cv` page that's structured HTML, not just a PDF link.

This site is the reference implementation. View source on any page. The first paragraph
of every article is in the HTML, not rendered. Every project tag is a `<li>`, not an `<img>`.
